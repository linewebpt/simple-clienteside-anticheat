# Anti-Cheat JavaScript Script

This JavaScript script provides a basic client-side anti-cheat mechanism for web applications. It detects changes to the DOM structure and monitors mouse movements to identify suspicious behavior. The script is intended to serve as a starting point for developers looking to implement simple client-side checks to enhance the integrity of their web applications.

# Usage:

- Include the script in your web application.
- Customize the script to fit your specific requirements.
- Periodic checks for DOM changes and mouse movements are performed, triggering alerts for suspicious behavior.


#### Note: This script is a basic example and should be complemented by robust server-side checks for a more comprehensive anti-cheat solution.
